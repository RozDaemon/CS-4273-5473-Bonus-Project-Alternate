# CS-4273-5473-Bonus-Project-Alternate

This project, created by Yuhan Jin, was one of our choices for the CS-4273-5473 Bonus Project. While we ended up choosing Brandon Fletcher's calculator, it was simply because
not all of us could use XCode. This calculator is still very well written, and these files can absolutely be explored and run with a MacOS machine.
